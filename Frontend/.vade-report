# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation

## Summary
Successfully installed and configured Vercel Speed Insights for this Next.js 16.1.4 App Router project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/speed-insights` version 1.3.1 using pnpm
- Package added to dependencies in package.json
- Created pnpm-lock.yaml to lock dependency versions

### 2. Code Changes
**Modified: app/layout.tsx**
- Added import: `import { SpeedInsights } from "@vercel/speed-insights/next"`
- Added `<SpeedInsights />` component inside the `<body>` tag, after the closing `</AuthProvider>` tag
- Component placement follows Next.js best practices for App Router

## Implementation Details

Since this is a Next.js 16.1.4 project (newer than 13.5) using the App Router:
- Used the recommended import from `@vercel/speed-insights/next`
- Added the component to the root layout (app/layout.tsx)
- No additional configuration or props needed (automatic route detection)
- Component is rendered as a sibling to the main content, after the Footer

## Verification

✅ Package successfully installed
✅ Lock file (pnpm-lock.yaml) created
✅ Code changes implemented following Next.js App Router patterns
✅ ESLint validation passed for modified files (app/layout.tsx has no linting errors)
✅ All existing code structure preserved
✅ TypeScript imports properly typed

## Notes

- The build process encountered pre-existing Firebase configuration errors (missing environment variables), which are unrelated to the Speed Insights implementation
- The Speed Insights component will automatically collect and send performance metrics when deployed to Vercel
- No additional configuration is required - the component works out of the box with Next.js App Router
- The component is lightweight and won't impact page performance

## Files Changed

1. `package.json` - Added @vercel/speed-insights dependency
2. `app/layout.tsx` - Added SpeedInsights import and component
3. `pnpm-lock.yaml` - Created lock file for consistent dependency resolution
